		<p>
			Pascal Siakam was born in Douala, Cameroon, in 1994. He grew up playing soccer and was introduced to basketball at the age of 15 by his older brothers. Siakam&rsquo;s father passed away in a car accident when he was just 
			two years old, and he and his five siblings were raised by their mother, who worked as a farmer to support the family. Siakam attended high school in the United States at God&rsquo;s Academy in Lewisville, Texas, and 
			later played college basketball at New Mexico State University. Despite his unconventional path to the NBA, Siakam has become a rising star in the league and an important player for the Toronto Raptors.
